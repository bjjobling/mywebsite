	<h2>Something catchy here</h2>
	<p>A smart man told me recently that I would be wise to become
	familiar with JavaScript. so the purpose of this page is to help me explore
	the basics as I build my knowledge and competency. The same good gentleman
	also indicated that .xml should also be on my radar, so I'm glad we have a
	three-day weekend coming up...</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>A practical matter</h2>
	<p>For a while I owned a sailboat, and every sailor wants to know how
	fast their boat can go. The two things a sailor must know to go fast
	are the strength and relative direction of the wind. This information
	is provided to newer boat owners via a designer's performance chart known
	as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_diagram_(sailing)">
	polar diagram</a>. The diagram would provide a potential hull speed over a
	range of wind speeds and relative wind angles.</p>
	<img src="Polar_wiki_180x240.jpg" alt "polar chart explanatory
	diagram">
	<p>Like many boats of its era, my 1977 Tartan 37, <i>Island Pearl,</i> did
	not come with such a chart. However, over the years various Tartan owners
	had gathered performance data on their own boats and shared with other
	owners on the forums. Some had submitted it to the Offshore Racing Congress
	for inclusion in their <a href="https://jieter.github.io/orc-data/site/
	#GRE/GRE1495">sailboat performance database</a>.</p>
	<p>In 2020 I imported variously-sourced Tartan 37 data into an excel 
	spreadsheet, along with that of it's European stablemate the Condor 37,
	and produced polar charts which I then uploaded to the Tartan 37 Owner's
	forum.</p>
	<p>A copy of my original spreadsheet can be found
	<a href="Tartan 37 Polar numbers.htm">here</a>.</p>
	<h2>The challenge</h2>
	<p>To reproduce the polar charts I produced in Excel on the web page using
	JavaScript tools and .xml data imports. As I have a sum total of three
	days' reading on html and JavaScript this will be a 'proof of concept' 
	demonstration rather than 'best practices'.</p>
	<h2>Limitations</h2>
	One of the limitations I may already face is that the polar chart is not
	(or was not) native to Excel, and is a modified 'donut' chart, with polar
	coordinates <i>(r, Î¸)</i> converted to Cartesian <i>(x, y)</i> 
	coordinates.</p>
	<h3>Course of action #1</h3>
	<p>Both Plotly and Chart.js offer polar chart solutions, but so far neither
	seems to offer a true polar coordinate chart solution; rather, conversion
	to Cartesian coordinates may be required.</p>
	<h3>COA #2</h3>Project a Cartesian scatter or line chart onto a 
	polar/radar background image. This may be the simplest and most practical
	solution. Html allows for precise positioning and plotting of images on a 
	page; scaling for different devices will be in order.</p>
	
	<h2>The result</h2>
	<p>Hopefully something inspiring/successful here</p>
